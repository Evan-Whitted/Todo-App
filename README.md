Howdy, Partner. Welcome to my readme.toUpperCase(). There IS enough room for both of us in this town. 

This is my first full project in VS Code. My goal was to create a simple todo app where I could keep track of things I needed to finish each day. This app allows you to add, delete, and check off a list of todos. This project is in the small details. This project taught me how small design details can inform the user of next natural steps. 

# AngularTodoApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.1.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help
